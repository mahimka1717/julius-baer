    <p>Family-owned businesses account for more than <a href="https://unctad.org/news/empowering-family-businesses-fast-track-sustainable-development" target="_blank">70 per cent</a> of global GDP, yet many of those are poorly prepared for succession. As wealth moves from founders to their children – and sometimes grandchildren – tensions often arise around strategy, sustainability and shared leadership. According to an <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/family-enterprise/why-family-offices-need-refreshed-operating-models" target="_blank">EY survey</a>, just 40 per cent of family-run companies have a formal succession plan in place, and even fewer have addressed how that plan should evolve as the business and family grow.</p>
    <p>“When we look at sources of conflict in family systems, tradition versus innovation is a pretty classic one,” says Peter Vogel, Professor of Family Business and Entrepreneurship at IMD Business School. “Do we hold on to this business unit or not? Do we continue running this product even though it’s not profitable? There might be a reluctance to change, especially when the legacy of earlier generations is involved.”</p>
    <p>María Eugenia Mosquera, Head of Wealth Planning, Key Clients and Family Office Services at Julius Baer, a global wealth management company, agrees that there can be generational differences in vision and values that cause family conflict if not addressed early. “If there’s also a lack of a formal governance structure, then this becomes exacerbated,” she says. “Often this means there is no effective conflict resolution mechanism, an informal decision-making process and a delayed or non-transparent process in ownership succession planning.”</p>

    <h2>Where strategy meets psychology</h2>
    <p>Power shifts are rarely just about capital or control. As Vogel notes, they often involve “a fork in the road” between values and visions. In some cases, leadership succession and ownership succession are misaligned: operational control moves to the next generation, but financial power (and final veto) remains with the founders.</p>
    <p>This can cause problems if governance structures aren’t properly established, Vogel says. “We’ve seen situations where the next generation runs the business for years, only for the founder to say, ‘Actually, I disagree with your decisions. It’s still my company.’ That uncertainty of time frame – and uncertainty of what’s next for the senior generation – can cause real damage,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Multigenerational family boards face further complexity when trying to balance meritocracy with perceived nepotism. “Why her, not me? Why him, not me? These are real tensions – within and across generations,” Vogel says.</p>
    <p>For Mosquera, leadership succession and ownership succession do not need to be aligned all at the same time. “In a highly successful family we’ve advised, the owner entrusted the business to professional managers, excluded the next generation from operational roles and achieved both strong performance and family satisfaction with this model,” she adds.</p>

    <h2>The power of diverse perspectives</h2>
    <p>When handled well, however, generational diversity can be a strength. Research suggests that younger members of family boards are more likely to champion sustainability, employee wellbeing and digital innovation. A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2022/global-next-gen-survey-2022.html" target="_blank">PWC Next Gen survey</a> reveals that ESG initiatives can be accelerated by younger voices who are less beholden to legacy models. An <a href="https://www.imd.org/ibyimd/family-business/redefining-wealth-management-how-family-offices-can-lead-the-charge-in-responsible-investing-2/" target="_blank">IMD paper</a>, written by Vogel, supports this, suggesting that family offices are uniquely positioned to lead the charge in responsible investing – if empowered to act decisively.</p>
    <p>For Mosquera, creating space for different voices is essential. “Multigenerational boards are incredibly rich in terms of diversity of thought,” she says. “But that only works if we create environments where everyone is heard and valued.”</p>
    <p>That includes women. In regions with strong patriarchal cultures, female successors often face additional barriers. “It’s not just about family dynamics, but societal ones,” says Vogel. “In Asia or the Middle East, even the sons can struggle to challenge elders, let alone daughters.” Yet family businesses that take what <a href="https://kpmg.com/nz/en/home/insights/2024/06/global-family-business-survey.html" target="_blank">a KPMG study</a> calls a “dynamic” approach to legacy report stronger business performance compared to competitors.</p>

    <h2>Making succession successful</h2>
    <p>So how can families avoid the common pitfalls? For example, Mosquera recalls working with a business where the founder retained ultimate veto rights, even though his children – who were in their late forties – were running key parts of the business. “It wasn’t because of doubts about their capabilities. It was about emotion – the pride he had in creating that business – and there were also unresolved tensions between him and his siblings,” she says. “This is not unusual: I’ve seen founders in their eighties who still want to keep maximum control until the very end.”</p>
    <p>Julius Baer helped the family design a constitution, a family council, a shareholders’ agreement and a dividend and reinvestment policy, helping to give more structure to the business as well as reassurance to the founder. Preparing your children properly and early is also key, says Mosquera. “Educating your children to take over is a lifelong process, and if you haven’t done it properly then succession becomes challenging. If you don’t believe they can run it better than you then, frankly, you might be better off selling your business to someone who can. A sale should never be viewed as a failure. On the contrary, it can often be the most beneficial decision for everyone involved and it can help preserve what matters most: family unity.”</p>

    <p>Open communication and accountability are critical to developing next-generation leadership competence, according to a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10307980/" target="_blank">Frontiers in Psychology</a> report. Its study of 100 next-generation family business leaders found that when families encourage open dialogue, and hold emerging leaders responsible for their decisions, it strengthens their leadership effectiveness and emotional engagement in the business. In practice, this means anything from rotating board apprenticeships to charitable initiatives that foster entrepreneurial thinking.</p>
    <p>“In one large family we worked with, they had internal seed funds and mentorship programmes to train value creators in each generation,” says Vogel. “You can inherit shares, but dividends were tightly controlled. You’re rich on paper, but you still need a meaningful career. That creates a strong social contract.”</p>
    <p>Philanthropy, too, can be a proving ground. “We’ve seen younger members begin with values-led projects before taking on the core business. It’s a way to learn governance, strategy and financial responsibility – without the emotional weight of the legacy company,” says Vogel.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, strong family governance is less about preserving hierarchy than enabling continuity. This includes setting clear timelines for founders to step back and creating purposeful roles for them beyond the business. “We always ask not ‘what are you retiring from’, but ‘what are you retiring to?’,” says Vogel. “If there’s no answer to that question, it becomes very hard to let go.”</p>
    <p>For Mosquera, the most effective transitions are those that embrace change while honouring legacy. “Younger generations wish to honour the legacy they’ve inherited and are usually inspired to grow and transform it for the future,” she says. “If we can create bridges between generations, rather than walls, family businesses can continue thriving for decades to come.”</p>
